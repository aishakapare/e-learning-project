# e-learning-project
I developed a static e-learning website that emphasizes my frontend development skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This platform offers an engaging user interface that allows students to access a diverse array of courses. With a straightforward navigation structure and visually appealing design, users can browse and select courses, enroll, and track their progress.

A standout feature of this e-learning site is its certification functionality. Upon successfully completing a course, students receive certificates, providing a sense of accomplishment and motivation to pursue further learning. This aspect of the site encourages continuous engagement, transforming it into an effective educational tool.

The siteâ€™s layout, styled with Bootstrap, ensures responsive design across various devices, offering an optimal experience whether students are on desktops, tablets, or smartphones. Additionally, CSS animations enhance interactivity, making the learning journey visually appealing and smooth. This e-learning website serves as a demonstration of my technical expertise and ability to create user-friendly, impactful educational platforms.
